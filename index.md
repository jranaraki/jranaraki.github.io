I am a senior ML researcher in the IaaS team at [Huawei Technologies Canada](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/) with over seven years of experience delving into theoretical and practical applications of ML. With experience building scalable ML systems, LLM inference frameworks, and time-series forecasting pipelines. Proven track record in optimizing models, deploying real-world solutions, and mentoring junior engineers and students across bachelor’s to PhD levels.

Previously, I was a [Mitacs Elevate](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/elevate) postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.utoronto.ca/), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://hollandbloorview.ca/), working with [Tom Chau](https://bme.utoronto.ca/faculty-research/core-faculty/tom-chau/) on ML tools to translate EEG signals into actions helping kids with severe movement disabilities.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Memorial University of Newfoundland](http://www.mun.ca/), supervised by [Saeed Samet](http://ssamet.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/), [Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) and [Hamid Usefi](http://www.math.mun.ca/~usefi/). I developed a noise-robust and scalable feature selection method called Perturbation-based Feature Selection (PFS), inspired by the historical monument in [Isfahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan) called [Monar Jonban (Shaking Minarets)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monar_Jonban), and implemented using perturbation theory and system of equations.
