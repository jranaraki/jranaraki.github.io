I am a senior ML researcher in the IaaS team at [Huawei Technologies Canada](https://www.huawei.com/ca/), working on designing and improving timeseries forecasting and prediction-based auto-scaler methods for serverless environments.

Previously, I was a [Mitacs Elevate](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/elevate) postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.utoronto.ca/), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://hollandbloorview.ca/), working with [Tom Chau](https://bme.utoronto.ca/faculty-research/core-faculty/tom-chau/) on ML tools to translate EEG signals into actions helping kids with severe movement disabilities.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Memorial University of Newfoundland](http://www.mun.ca/), supervised by [Saeed Samet](http://ssamet.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/), [Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) and [Hamid Usefi](http://www.math.mun.ca/~usefi/). I developed a new noise-robust and scalable feature selection method called perturbation-based feature selection inspired by a historical monument in [Isfahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan) called [Monar Jonban (Shaking Minarets)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monar_Jonban), and implemented using perturbation theory and system of equations.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Engineering (AI) from the [Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman](http://uk.ac.ir/en/home), supervised by [Mahdi Eftekhari](https://uk.ac.ir/en/~m.eftekhari) and [Majid Mohammadi](https://depeng.uk.ac.ir/en/~mohammadi), where I proposed improvements on existing fuzzy-rough set-based feature selection methods.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani University](http://en.ashrafi.ac.ir/), supervised by [Marjan Kaedi](http://eng.ui.ac.ir/~kaedi), where I designed and implemented a pipeline to train a self-organizing map neural network to recognize Persian handwritten digits.
